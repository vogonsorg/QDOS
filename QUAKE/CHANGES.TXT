Quake v1.09 for DOS with WATTCP Stack
Original Concept and WATTCP import coding by NeoZeed
Coding by [HCI]Mara'akate

Additional code from sezero, taniwha, spoike, LordHavoc, 
   QuakeForge, FitzQuake, Quakespasm, Darkplaces and more.
---------------------------------------------------------

* DEVELOPER values are now set with flags.  Setting to Developer 1 will still
  show all types of developer printfs, EXCEPT extreme verbose stuff (which was
  normally commented out in the code).  These flags are set just like dmflags
  in Quake 2. I.e. adding the values for the ones you want.
  A few flags are currently unused, hence the jump in numbers.

  Available values:
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_STANDARD - Standard msgs			// 2
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_SOUND - Sound msgs				// 4
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_NET - Network msgs				// 8
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_IO - File IO msgs				// 16
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_VIDEO - Graphics renderer msgs		// 32
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_CD - CD Player msgs				// 64
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_MEM - Memory management msgs			// 128
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_SERVER - Server msgs				// 256
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_PROGS - Progs msgs				// 512
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_PHYSICS - Physics msgs			// 2048
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_ENTITY - Entity msgs				// 16384
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_SAVE - Save/Restore msgs			// 32768
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_VERBOSE - Extremely verbose msgs		// 65536
* Tab completion with console commands will show all possible cmds, aliases,
  and cvars.  Denoted with [C], [A], and [V] respectively.
  This behavior can be disabled with console_old_complete 1.
* Fixed S_KHZ goof-up with GUS MAX/GUS PnP cards.
* Gravis UltraSound stuttering during map transitions, etc. fixed.
* TYPE command.  Use this as a notepad.  Useful for reading CFGs in game
  and map readmes.
* Warpspasm will now play the music without the 3D spatializing effect.
* Load music from WAV.  **THIS IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL!**
  If you plan to use this, it MUST be 44khz/16bit *MONO* and you must
  have at least 128MB RAM allocated via -mem or -heapsize!
  Stereo cuts off at 1:35'ish mark.  I have not figured out why.
  Files go into sound/cdtracks/trackX.wav where X is track number.
  Currently porting S_RawSamples from Quake 2 to allow streaming 
  without a huge memory allocation and should fix the stereo issue.
* Now compressed with UPX -9 for sneakernet dudes.
* MAX_DATAGRAM reduced from 32000 to 8000.  Causing IPX issues.
  If this breaks support connecting to Fitz servers let me know.
* SV_LOADENTFILES warns you if an ENT file is loaded.
* Fixed SV_LOADENTFILES to only load from the gamedir.
* Rare bug involving playdemo and connection state

* SV_DUMPENTITIES.  Dump entities of current map into your /maps gamedir.
* SV_LOADENTFILES.  Defaults to 1.  Allows use of external ent files.
  Coded adapted from MVDSV.
* TIMESTAMP.  Set to 1 for military time, 2 for 12hr AM/PM format.
* Various FitzQuake imports including: Dynamic game directory loading,
  Cmdlist, Unalias, and probably a few others I can't remember.
* Nehahra Menus work properly.
* "-quoth", "-warp", and "-nehahra" paramater support.
* PF_TRACETOSS QC support.  For Nehahra, but other mods may be
  using this.  Thanks to LordHavoc for his code and advice.
* Menu shortcut keys.
  - 's', 'm', 'o', 'h', and 'q' at the main menu.
  - 'e' and 'v' at the options menu.
* BSP Version 28 (Quake Pre-Release) support.  Thanks to Engoo port guy.
* Flashlight command.  Bind a key to FLASHLIGHT.
* Partial Nehahra support.  Explosions effects are parsed, but do not
  have any special effects.
* Warpspasm support!!
* MAX_EDICTS for use with Fitzquake Protocol.
* Fitzquake Protocol (v666) support!
* Chat buffer upto 32 lines.  Thanks to taniwha for smarter code.
* CTRL+C to send disconnect from console.
* CTRL+Q for Instant Quit.
* Hack to hide the 'Unknown command: "init"' from runeq and other
   servers.
* Any new CVAR menu options have been moved to Extended Options Menu.
* CL_WARNCMD.  From QW.  Set to 0 to disable Unknown Command warnings.
* CL_UNBINDALL_PROTECTION.  This is enabled by default and is not saved
   in your CONFIG.CFG.  This protects you from accidentally typing in
   UNBINDALL or having a server doing this.  However, the UNBINDALL from
   DEFAULT.CFG will be parsed.
* SHOW_UPTIME.  Set to 1 for server time, 2 for total time you've wasted
   playing quake this sesion =).
* IN_FREELOOK.  Cvar for freelook/mouselook.
* SHOW_TIME.  Set to 1 for military time, 2 for 12hr AM/PM format.
   Thanks to Taniwha for some bits of code.
* Preliminary support for dstring from QF port.
* Fixed rare overflow bug with center prints if the video height was
   200.  Huge thanks to Taniwha!
* Support for connect IP:PORT.  It must be in this format.  I plan to
   add support for "connect IP PORT" as well.
* S_KHZ -- Allows you to change the sound speed.  It will be saved in your
   config.cfg.  You must do a SND_RESTART.  This will be read from your
   CONFIG.CFG on startup.
* K_END and K_HOME now function in console (thanks Taniwha for the hints).
* Autorepeating keys.
* SHOW_FPS -- Part of this is from Quakespasm port and some from QW.
   The CVAR is saved in your config.cfg and it is a menu option.
* SND_SHUTDOWN.
* MENU_ADDRESSBOOK -- It does work, but you need to set your own ADR0-ADR9.
   I plan to add an edit sub-menu and merge this into the TCP/IP menu.
* Pressing PGUP on console shows the "^ ^ ^ ^ ^" like QW does.
* Fixed a rare, nasty bug in CL_TENT.C (thanks Taniwha).
* CVARLIST from Quakespasm port.
* Mouse sensitivity slider goes up to 50.
* -safevga.  This will override your vid_mode (including any in CFGs) to start
   at 320x200.  -safe will also add this.
* "QUIT!" command.  Allows you to quit immediately with no confirmation.
* You can press enter on the quit screen to default pressing 'y'.
* All drivers now coexist peacefully (BW, MP, Serial, and IPX).  Huge thanks
   to Ozkan Sezer (sezero) of Hammer of Thyrion port for making this happen!
   Can't thank this guy enough for all his wonderful help!
* You can play QDOS without a packet driver.  Thanks to Ozkan Sezer (sezero)
   of Hammer of Thyrion port for the fix.  I hope to have all drivers
   coexisting peacefully (bw, mp, serial, and ipx) with WATT32 so you can
   load this on Win9X and still play online.
* CL_NODEMOS.  This will allow you to disable the startup demos.  It is
   stored in your config.cfg and there is a menu option for it.  You can
   also use -nodemo.
* CL_FULLPITCH and PQ_FULLPITCH support.  As far as I can tell, most servers
   have disabled it anyways.  It's best to add this to your autoexec.cfg as
   most servers will force it to become 0 if they don't want you using it
   for obvious cheating concerns.  There is also a menu value for this.
* Warning about potential sound corruption (and how to fix it) if a GUS is
   detected.
* F_Version reply support.  Confuse everyone during a game!
* Menu option for V_CONTENTBLEND.  This cvar will also be saved to your
   config.cfg.
* -nogus to disable checking ULTRASND environment variable (useful if you have
   two sound cards and one to use your SB16 instead).
* -nocd -- a little faster to type than -nocdaudio ;)
* JOY_RECALIBRATE allows you recalibrate your joystick any time in quake.
* Fixed it so you can do "MAKE CLEAN" and spits out qdos.exe
   instead of quake.exe.
* If -mem <value> is not defined it will default to 32MB (just like QW)
   instead of allocating all available RAM.
* 2GB fix from Hexen 2: HoT port.
* VESA ini corruption fix from Hexen 2: HoT port.
* Raised MAX_EFRAGS from 640->2048.
* Added V_CONTENTBLEND 0/1 cvar.  Finally, gl_polyblend comes to DOS!
* SND_RESTART -- Restarts the audio stack.
* -noclear to disable memory clearing.  If you start getting random
   crashes while playing try not using this.  If it still happens then
   it's probably some non-standard map.
* FOV > 90 Hack.
* Raised some limits for edicts, sound, etc. (Referenced from Darkplaces).
* -zone to default to 1024 for newer servers.
* Raised SURFCACHE_SIZE_AT_320_200 default from 600->4096 -- Should be able
   to set d_picmip 0 and avoid seeing the RAM icon (for most maps!).
* CD_AUDIO.C no longer has "press any key to continue" for MSCDEX errors.

QIP Fixes (http://www.inside3d.com/qip/home.shtml):
* Cache_Alloc: already allocated Fix.
* Coop not cleared when selecting SP through menu Fix.
* MOVETYPE_PUSH error with non bsp models Fix.
* SV_MAXVELOCITY Fix.
* Win9X/Fast PC timing Fix.
* Input is initialized before video (i.e. Joystick) Fix.
* Win9X false amount of allocated memory Fix.
* SB without BLASTER GPF Fix.

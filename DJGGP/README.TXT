This is the exact build environment that was used to compile Quake v1.09
with WATTCP/IP STACK for DOS.

Extract to C:\DJGPP with directory structures intact and run SETENV.BAT.

If you are running from pure DOS be sure to run SMARTDRV.EXE.

You CANNOT run this from a Windows 9X COMMAND.COM box!
Boot into safe mode with command prompt and run SMARTDRV.EXE then continue
if you are running Windows 9X.

Look at the INSTALL file for more information on installing Glide3.

Here are a few notes about building Glide3x from CVS.

1.) Top Level Source Organization
    The Glide source trees are branched by platform.  The platform
    names are internal names used at 3dfx.  Since these names may not
    make sense to others here is a quick list.

        sst1:  Voodoo Graphics
        sst96: Voodoo Rush
        cvg:   Voodoo 2
        h3:    Voodoo Banshee/Voodoo 3
        h5:    The VSA-100 chip set used in the Voodoo4 and Voodoo5
               line of products.

2.) The New Way of getting Glide from CVS.
    There is now a CVS module to get glide3 named Glide3.  If you get
    this, you will get everything you need.  All of the relevant
    projects, cvs, h3 and h5, are included, as well as swlibs.

3.) The Old Way of getting Glide from CVS.
    The top level module needed are glide3x and swlibs.  The glide3x
    module has only the glide code, without swlibs.

    All glide source trees use a common set of libraries kept in the
    swlibs branch.  In order to build any glide library the swlibs
    branch must be moved inside the glide3x directory.  The swlibs
    branch is not stored here within the glide3x cvs tree because it
    is also shared with the glide2x branch.  N.B.: If you use the CVS
    module Glide3, swlibs will be in the right place, and does not
    need to be moved.

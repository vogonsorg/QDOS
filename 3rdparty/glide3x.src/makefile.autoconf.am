# This is the root of all the makefile.autoconfs.  The
# build rules are:
# o All makefiles are named makefile.autoconf, with
#   some suffices for automake and swlibs/bin/autogen.sh
#   templates.
#   NOTE: The script autogen.sh is not the package
#         autogen.  Perhaps it should be, but it is not.
# o The suffices are:
#       .am      Input to automake as usual.
#                These files are created by concatenating
#                mumble.inner and
#                swlibs/include/make/makefile.autoconf.bottom.
#       .in      Input to configure as usual.  There are only
#                three non-automake made files:
#                configure.in, build.3dfx.in and config.h.in.
# o The bits which go into a C file compilation are
#     CC             : The C compiler we use.
#     DEFS           : Compiler options which are not cpp options.
#     INCLUDES       : -I preprocessor definitions
#     CPPFLAGS       : -D preprocessor definitions.
#     CFLAGS         : -g and -Ox ccompiler options
#   This is enforced by automake.
#
#   The values we use for DEFS, INCLUDES, CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS are
#   created using three parts.  To create part MUMBLE, concatenate:
#     GMUMBLE        : Global MUMBLE, determined at config time.
#     LMUMBLE        : Local MUMBLE, defined in each directory.
#     VMUMBLE        : Variable MUMBLE, defined in each directory.
#   The Variable definitions are needed, since automake will
#   now allow variables to be defined both inside and outside
#   of automake conditionals.
# o The bits which go into linking a program are:
# o The bits which go into making a static library are:
# o The bits which go into making a shared library are:
# o During every config/reconfig, after all the makefiles
#   have been created, we make the installincludes target
#   in each subdirectory.  This target is responsible for
#   installing include files in the private include
#   directory.

QuakeWorld v2.40 for DOS with WATTCP Stack
Original Concept and WATTCP import coding by NeoZeed
Coding by [HCI]Mara'akate

Additional code from sezero, taniwha, spoike, LordHavoc, 
   QuakeForge, Fitzquake, Quakespasm, Darkplaces and more.
---------------------------------------------------------

* -cddir for specifiy a cd drive path for pak files.  Also for keeping
  WAV/OGG music in a separate drive.
* 3DFX Voodoo rendering with fxMesa 6.4.2!  Check voodoo directory for 
  your glide3x.dxe.
* QuakeForge HTTP downloading extension support.
* Scaleable maximum bmodel edges with r_maxbmodeledges.
* V-Sync control via extended menu options.
* Gamespy Server Browser accessible from Multiplayer Menu and with slist2
  command.  Adapted from Q2DOS.
* Scaleable particle sizes for SVGA resolutions.  Use sw_particle_size_override
  and friends to set more custom values.
* Fixed GameSpy /slist2 command to be a lot faster.
* OGG and WAV music support in format of /id1/music/trackXX.
* DEVELOPER values are now set with flags.  Setting to Developer 1 will still
  show all types of developer printfs, EXCEPT extreme verbose stuff (which was
  normally commented out in the code).  These flags are set just like dmflags
  in Quake 2. I.e. adding the values for the ones you want.
  A few flags are currently unused, hence the jump in numbers.

  Available values:
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_STANDARD - Standard msgs			// 2
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_SOUND - Sound msgs				// 4
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_NET - Network msgs				// 8
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_IO - File IO msgs				// 16
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_VIDEO - Graphics renderer msgs		// 32
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_CD - CD Player msgs				// 64
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_MEM - Memory management msgs			// 128
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_PHYSICS - Physics msgs			// 2048
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_ENTITY - Entity msgs				// 16384
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_SAVE - Save/Restore msgs			// 32768
  * DEVELOPER_MSG_VERBOSE - Extremely verbose msgs		// 65536
* Added FTE extensions for 256 packet entities, double models 1,
  double models 2, spawn static 2, and chunked downloads.
* Tab completion with console commands will show all possible cmds, aliases,
  and cvars.  Denoted with [C], [A], and [V] respectively.
  This behavior can be disabled with console_old_complete 1.
* Fixed S_KHZ goof-up with GUS MAX/GUS PnP cards.
* Gravis UltraSound stuttering during map transitions, etc. fixed.
* Rare bug involving playdemo and connection state

* Added S,M,O,H,Q shortcuts on Main Menu.  Thought I ported
  this over from QDOS, but I guess I forgot!
* Hack so changing SPECTATOR CVAR will cause a reconnect.
* Maximum FPS of 240.  Must use CL_MAXFPS to enable.
* Firing your weapon will return you from AFK.
* Fixed a serious bug with the CHAT CVAR which could
  make you unable to shoot.
* Fixed some potential userinfo spamming with AFK mode.
* SETINFO CHAT is also a CVAR.
* TIMESTAMP.  Set to 1 for military time, 2 for 12hr AM/PM format.
* SHOW_PING.  Set to 1 to show your ping on screen.
* Fixed some maps bombing relating to MAX_PHYSENT overflow.  The limit has
  been raised from 32 -> 96 and there is now a check in place so it cannot
  go over this amount.  Yeah, yeah.  Had to cheat and 'port' QWDOS to
  Windows so I could debug the issue.
* NET_BROADCAST_CHAT.  Disable chat broadcasting.
* Chat buffer upto 32 lines.  Thanks to taniwha for smarter code.
* CTRL+C to send disconnect from console.
* CTRL+R to send reconnect from console.
* CTRL+Q for instant quit.
* Fixed a skin bug related to magic number crap.
* Any new CVAR menu options have been moved to Extended Options Menu.
* CL_UNBINDALL_PROTECTION.  This is enabled by default and is not saved
   in your CONFIG.CFG.  This protects you from accidentally typing in
   UNBINDALL or having a server doing this.  However, the UNBINDALL from
   DEFAULT.CFG will be parsed.
* SHOW_UPTIME.
* IN_FREELOOK.  Cvar for freelook/mouselook.
* Fixed so TOGGLEMENU works after a DISCONNECT.
* Fixed Sys_DoubleTime, which in turn fixed SHOW_FPS.
* SHOW_TIME.  Set to 1 for military time, 2 for 12hr AM/PM format.
   Thanks to Taniwha for some bits of code.
* CL_ALLOWNEWMAP.  This will allow you to play version 30 maps.  It is highly
   unsupported.  But, I'd like to hear your results!
* SKINS cmd while disconnected won't bomb.  Thanks to Taniwha for QF hint.
* Preliminary support for dstring from QF port.
* Autorepeating keys.
* Fixed rare overflow bug with center prints if the video height was
   200.  Huge thanks to Taniwha!
* Fixed a rare, nasty bug in CL_TENT.C (thanks Taniwha).
* S_KHZ -- Allows you to change the sound speed.  It will be saved in your
   config.cfg.  You must do a SND_RESTART.  This will be read from your
   CONFIG.CFG on startup.
* Mouse sensitivity slider goes up to 50.
* -safevga.  This will override your vid_mode (including any in CFGs) to start
   at 320x200.  -safe will also add this.
* "QUIT!" command.  Allows you to quit immediately with no confirmation.
* You can press enter on the quit screen to default pressing 'y'.
* Warning about potential sound corruption (and how to fix it) if a GUS is
   detected.
* Menu options for V_CONTENTBLEND, NET_SHOWCHAT, and NET_SHOWCHATGFX.
   These cvars will also be saved to your config.cfg.
* When a user is typing they will glow and a rotating Quad Damage will be
   above their head.  There are varying luminosity offsets depending if the
   user is typing, afk, or afk and typing.  The Quad Damaga will spin faster
   depending on the state as well.  (Huge thanks to Spoike for QD MDL Code!)
* -nogus to disable checking ULTRASND environment variable (useful if you have
   two sound cards and want to use your SB16 instead)
* -nocd -- a little faster to type than -nocdaudio ;)
* JOY_RECALIBRATE allows you recalibrate your joystick any time in quake.
* Fixed it so you can do "MAKE CLEAN"
* 2GB fix from Hexen 2: HoT port
* VESA ini corruption fix from Hexen 2: HoT port
* Added /V_CONTENTBLEND 0/1 cvar.  Finally, gl_polyblend comes to DOS!
* /NET_SHOWCHAT 1 to have it tell you if someone else is typing! (Server must
   support setinfo chat reporting)
* Raised MAX_EFRAGS 500 -> 2048
* /MEMCLEAR command to force CL_ClearState() (must be used disconnected)
* "QuakeWorld DOS vx.xx-xxxx" reported as *ver
* /AFK command to send out AFK to EZQ clients
* SND_RESTART -- Restarts the audio stack.
* -noclear to disable memory clearing.  If you start getting random
   crashes while playing try not using this.  If it still happens then
   it's probably some non-standard map.
* Raised MAX_MAP_MODELS 256->1024
* Raised MAX_PACKET_ENTITIES 64->600
* Raised MAX_MOD_KNOWN 256->2048
* setinfo chat reporting for EZQ clients
* CD_AUDIO.C no longer has "press any key to continue" for MSCDEX errors
* Surface Cache size is shown in console again like NQ
* Raised SURFCACHE_SIZE_AT_320_200 default from 600->4096 -- Should be able
   to set d_picmip 0 and avoid seeing the RAM icon (for most maps!).
* Raised MAX_INFO_STRING 196->512
* -zone to default to 1024 for newer servers
* CD_AUDIO.C fixed for DOS compile
* Raised MAX_LBM_HEIGHT 200->480 -- Fixes skin size errors
* Raised MAX_SERVERINFO_STRING 512->2048 -- Fixes Mod_PointLeaf errors (Thanks
   Spoike)
* Raised MAX_SOUNDS and MAX_MODELS 256->1024 -- Load larger maps
* Mod_LoadAliasGroup: interval<=0 error workaround -- Fixes on connect error
   (Thanks Spoike)
* Sys_FloatTime->Sys_DoubleTime -- Fixes many errors related to timing.
   640x400 and above now playable! (Thanks LordHavoc)

Windows: * Pick /quake or /qw and run Make -f Makefile.  Check these files
           with a text editor for options.  Generally, you would want
           make -f Makefile for Software and make -f Makefile GLQUAKE=1 for
           3DFX.
         * makesse.bat will build an SSE optimized build targeted for Pentium 3
           and later processors with 3DFX cards.  SSE builds are entirely
           unsupported but appear to run with no issues.
         * NOTE: makesse.bat has hard-coded paths to my machine for
                 distribution.  Check these batch files and modify
                 to your needs.

Linux  : You need a Linux-to-DJGPP cross compiler toolchain based on DJGPP-2.05.
         I use a toolchain with gcc-3.4.6, binutils-2.25.1 and DJGPP-2.05.
         See the cross_build.sh to see how I do it myself; edit those scripts to
         represent your own build environment properly.
         * individual cross_build.sh scripts to build only the wanted components.
